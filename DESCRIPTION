Title: Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set
Version: 0.1.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Paul", "Hendricks", , "paul.hendricks.2013@owu.edu", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This data set provides information on the fate of passengers on
    the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner "Titanic", with variables
    such as economic status (class), sex, age, and survival. Whereas the base
    R Titanic data found by calling data("Titanic") is an array resulting from
    cross-tabulating 2201 observations, these data sets are individual
    non-aggregated observations and formatted in a machine learning context
    with a training sample, a testing sample, and two additional data sets
    that can be used for deeper machine learning analysis. These data sets
    are used in a very well known Kaggle competition; formatting the raw
    data sets in a package hopefully lowers the barrier to entry for users
    new to R and machine learning.
