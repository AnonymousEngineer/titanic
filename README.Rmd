`titanic` is an R package containing data sets providing information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden voyage of the ocean liner "Titanic", with variables such as economic status (class), sex, age and survival. These data sets are often used as an introduction to machine learning on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). More details about the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), and the original data sets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
